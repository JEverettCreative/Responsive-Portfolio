                <p>Jonathan Everett wrote his first line of code when he was 8 years old. Nearly 20 years later, he wrote his second line of code. After that, he was hooked and decided to become a professional full-stack web developer.</p>
                <p>Growing up just a few miles off the Arnold Engineering Air Force base as the son of an aerospace engineer-turned-software engineer, Jonathan was raised to think like an engineer. But he also had a deeply-rooted creative drive. </p>
                <p>Between those first two lines of code, Jonathan spent a lot of time looking for some type of balance between his scientific and academic upbringing and his creative inclinations. He got his Bachelor of Science in Psychology, and then found success in the local film industry as an actor, screenwriter, director, and producer. It was when preparing his website for his filmmaking endeavors that Jonathan rediscovered coding.</p>
                <p>Diving into the fundamentals of web development, he realized something -- Here was a career <em>where his creativity and engineering aptitude could be blended perfectly</em>. He made the decision that day to become a professional developer.</p>
